# KooQueue

Originally I thought of naming this project PhoQueue (which obviously stands for Phone Queue) but it just didn't sound right.

## Problem
Due to TRAI regulations, Kookoo does not send promotional or transactional SMSes after 9pm until 9am. And also Kookoo does not queue these SMSes to send on the following day. So a business/startup/company cannot make sure that these SMSes reach their target audience after 9pm. Hence we need a service that can queue up these "pushes" to be completed on the following day.

## Solution
